# Software Engineering Project

## Overview

This project is designed to demonstrate a comprehensive application utilizing Flask, Celery, and SQLAlchemy, among other technologies. It requires a MySQL database and is intended for educational and demonstration purposes.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or later
- MySQL Database
- MySQL Workbench (Recommended for database manipulation)

## Setup

### Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Software-Engineering-Project
```

### Environment Setup

#### For Mac Users:

Run the provided `setup_env.sh` script to create a virtual environment, activate it, and install the required Python packages:

```bash
./setup_env.sh
```

#### For Windows and Linux Users:

Ensure you have Python and pip installed on your system. Then, create a virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
# Windows
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Linux
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Database Setup

1. Ensure MySQL is installed and running on your system.
2. Open MySQL Workbench and connect to your MySQL server.
3. Create a new database named `sustainability_app_data`:
   
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE sustainability_app_data;
   ```
   
4. Ensure the `admin` user exists and set the password to `Hanad2020@`. If not, create the user and grant it permissions:

   ```sql
   CREATE USER 'admin'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'Hanad2020@';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON sustainability_app_data.* TO 'admin'@'localhost';
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   ```

   Make sure the `admin` user has full read and write access to the `sustainability_app_data` database.

## Running the Application

To run the application, use the following command:

```bash
python3 app.py
```

The application will start, and you can access it through your web browser.
